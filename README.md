# llmRPG
This project is an unfinished Role-Playing Game (RPG) that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate interactive dialogues and actions. It is based on the example from WebLLM.

## Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Google Chrome browser
- GPU acceleration enabled (if available)

## Setup Instructions
1. Enable GPU Acceleration in Google Chrome
To run the code using your GPU, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://settings.
2. Scroll down and click on "Advanced".
3. In the "System" section, enable "Use hardware acceleration when available".
4. Verify that GPU acceleration is working by visiting chrome://gpu.
2. Select the Correct GPU
   
### If you have multiple GPUs, make sure to select the correct one from the Windows settings:
1. Open Windows Settings.
2. Go to "System" > "Display" > "Graphics settings".
3. Select "Desktop app" and click "Browse" to find Google Chrome.
4. Click on "Options" and choose the high-performance GPU.
   
### Note: Changing these settings may cause loading issues for certain websites, such as ChatGPT, making them unusable after these modifications.

Running the Code
The code requires you to download your model. Tests have been conducted on smaller models. The system prompt has been modified. While requests work, development was not completed within the allotted time frame.
